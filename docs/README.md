# unitorch

> unitorch simplifies training & inference for deep learning models using modern best practices


### What it is
unitorch provides efficient implementation of popular unified NLU / NLG / CV / MM / RL models with PyTorch. It automatically optimizes training / inference speed based on pupular deep learning toolkits (transformers, fairseq, fastseq, etc) without accuracy loss.<br>
